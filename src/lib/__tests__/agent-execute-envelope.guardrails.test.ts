/**
 * Two seams found by operating a fresh instance through the MCP gateway, both of
 * the silent-failure class this repo keeps relearning.
 *
 * THE ENVELOPE LIE. agent-execute computed handlerFailed, logged 'failed' to
 * agent_activity — and then returned status:'success' unconditionally. Four page
 * updates failed server-side while the caller printed four green checkmarks; the
 * journal and the response disagreed about the same event. An agent that trusts
 * that envelope reports work it never did, which is the incident class the
 * objective-evidence guardrail exists for (objectives close on agent_activity,
 * never on prose — and here the prose-facing side was the lying one).
 *
 * THE IDENTIFIER GAP. manage_page update answered only "page_id is required"
 * although the caller held a perfectly good slug, and although resolvePageId —
 * which accepts either — already existed in the same function for
 * manage_page_blocks. The fix is the established contract (manage_wiki_page,
 * manage_kb_article): accept a slug wherever an id is wanted, except create,
 * where the slug names the new page.
