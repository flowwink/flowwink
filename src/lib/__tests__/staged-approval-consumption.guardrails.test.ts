/**
 * A staged approval is consumed only when the call actually runs.
 *
 * Found while driving install_template through its own gates (2026-08-08):
 * install_template is DOUBLE-GATED (requires_staging AND trust_level='approve').
 * The staging gate marked the operation 'executed' the moment a valid
 * _approved_operation_id arrived — BEFORE the trust gate had decided. Passing
 * only that flag (without _approved) therefore burned the approval on a call
 * that then did nothing: status='executed', execution_result NULL, no work, and
 * the retry answered 403 'not approved' because the row was no longer
 * 'approved'. The status lied about the outcome, and the operator had to
 * re-stage a decision they had already made.
