/**
 * Write surfaces must accept the identifiers their read surfaces accept (#99).
 *
 * Found by driving the gateway as an external agent would: `manage_page`
 * resolves a slug, but `manage_page_blocks` answered "page_id is required";
 * `manage_kb_article` action=get resolves a TITLE, but action=update answered
 * "article_id or slug is required". Both times the agent held a perfectly good
 * identifier and had to go find another one — a write surface pickier than the
 * read surface that precedes it is a trap, not a safeguard.
 *
 * The class is easy to reintroduce (a new action destructures only the id), so
 * this pins the resolution points rather than the prose.
