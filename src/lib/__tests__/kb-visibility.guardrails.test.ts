 * The internal KB tier. Audience used to be a property of the TABLE — the chunk
 * indexer hardcoded 'public' for every kb_articles row and 'internal' for every
 * wiki_pages row — so the only way to hide internal Q&A was to move it to the
 * wiki and lose the KB's shape. Found on optic, where five sales playbooks
 * written in the seller's voice were published on the public help centre.
 *
 * These guards cover the ways the tier can silently stop working: retrieval
 * flattening it back to a constant, a public surface forgetting the filter, and
 * the agent path being unable to author internal articles at all.
